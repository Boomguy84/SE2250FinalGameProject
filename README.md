# SE2250FinalGameProject
Final project for SE2250 where we designed a game in Unity

To play, follow instructions on screen. If launching directly from unity, the starting scene is _MainMenu. To progress to the next level make sure all enemies are killed to achieve the necessary point requirement.

There are 40 possible points in the first area, and 160 in the second. The first area in level two has 105 points to collect, and 100 more in the next section. Collecting all the points will allow the game to end. 

Within level one area 2, there is a knife pickup, upon pickup it will tell you what it does. Heart and diamond pickups will start appearing in level 2. Hearts grant full HP and diamonds grant temporary invincibility.
